## Overview
EatWhat is a "recommendation notes" community for diners. In our community, users can share restaurant reviews and restaurant introductions, that is, "recommendation notes." By sharing restaurant reviews such as text and pictures, users recorded the real praise and complaints about the restaurant from every diner who wrote down notes. We are a community, not a simple restaurant list display app.
## Target people
As we mentioned in the introduction, our target group is diners who love food, are willing to share, and want to get noticed. Such gluttons often love to visit stores and share their experience of restaurants. But in traditional restaurant recommendation software, their reviews need to slide down several times before they can be seen, and often only a few reviews can be displayed on the page. As a result, much equally good and thoughtful sharing is drowned out in the restaurant’s informative profile. What sets us apart from traditional restaurant recommendation software is that we are committed to providing a community of diners rather than a platform for restaurant review recommendations. We hope to provide foodies with a focus on their experience, rather than making their experience just part of a restaurant recommendation. Our focus is on the diner's community, and what we admire is the sharing of a consumption experience.
