## Overview
EatWhat is a "recommendation notes" community for diners. In our community, users can share restaurant reviews and restaurant introductions, that is, "recommendation notes." By sharing restaurant reviews such as text and pictures, users recorded the real praise and complaints about the restaurant from every diner who wrote down notes. We are a community, not a simple restaurant list display app.
## Target people
🍴 Users looking for nearby restaurants 
🤔 Hard to pick a restaurant for dinner 
💯 Users who want to share their dining experienceher than making their experience just part of a restaurant recommendation. Our focus is on the diner's community, and what we admire is the sharing of a consumption experience.
